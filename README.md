# Portfolio 2024 🐢

This is a peek at my first website that I entirely created from scratch, starting from some really confused ideas about the needs of frameworks for making websites (altough I've used Astro which was more than adeguate and easy to learn for an inexperienced coder such as myself). Right now (September 2025) this website will be my personal business card for at least the beginnings of 2026, from which I'll have a much simpler website, in lieu of building a more sustainable impact of my digital works on the internet and also because the css of this website is a nightmare to modify (what I was thinking for gods sake...)

Still I strongly suggest for any beginners such a myself to try build a website/blog with Astro, it was a fun experience!

Some "interesting" facts about my website:
- the content is completely manage locally on my computer as .md files using Obsidian and symlinks
- the page 404 I still believe it's really funny
- I started creating this website mobile first, then forgot about it, then tried to adjust everything using media, then crying in an angle of my room
- I'm 100% convinced that 80% of the css code could be deleted, but I'm too ~afraid..~ lazy to try
