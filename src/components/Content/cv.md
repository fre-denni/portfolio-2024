### From Art School to Design

I started my creative journey in my high school in Rome were I learned crafting techiniques and digital tools, but especially the capacity of present and explain my projects. <br/> Art wasn't 100% my thing, so I then got interest in the world of multimedia design and product design.

### Politecnico di Milano

After high school I went to study Industrial Design at Politecnico di Milano, one of the best university in the world. During my stay there I learned that Design is not only about tools or solving problems, but in its capacity of share and express your ideas correctly.

### Right now 

Now I'm concluding my second run at Politecnico finishing my master in Digital Interaction Design, where I refined my skill and learned more especially in Web Design and Coding, which you can see as I made this website from scratch!
