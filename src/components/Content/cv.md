### From Art School to Design

I started my creative journey in my high school in Rome where I learned crafting techniques and digital tools, but especially the capacity to present and explain my projects.
Art wasn’t 100% my thing, so I became interested in multimedia design and product design.

### Politecnico di Milano

After high school, I went to study Industrial Design at Politecnico di Milano, one of the best universities in the world.
During my stay there I learned that Design is not only about tools or solving problems, but its capacity to share and express your ideas correctly.

### Right now

Now I’m concluding my second run at Politecnico finishing my master's in Digital Interaction Design, where I refined my skills and learned more especially in Web Design and Coding.
