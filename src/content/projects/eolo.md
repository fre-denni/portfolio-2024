### Eolo is a puzzle-platform game that works as a way to do a spirometry test by adding a playful spin on the game commands. In the game you are a castaway that is blocked on a lost island and found a magical vuvuzela that can bring forth the power of the winds to push the raft away to safety and home.
### But be aware sailor, there are dangers in the water.

#### PLAYFUL EXPERIENCE

If you put a paper boat in a speck of water and blow on it using a straw, you could actually make it float away and make races with your friends to determine which boat is the fastest or, more realistically, which one of you has the best pulmonary capacity. 

In [spirometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry) is common to have little games to play using your breath strength, to take away all the medical formalities and have a playful experience, and this inspired me to make a little game prototype, that could mirror the joy of a paper boat race.

#### THE GAMEPLAY

In the gameplay the player has to evade dangerous perils and make it to the end of the level, while directing the flow of air in the correct position to move the raft along. 

The tests data are all collected on a company app for the doctors, that they could also use to set the difficulty of the game based on the results, in order to continue monitoring.

Here you can see a gameplay example:

#### PROTOTYPE

For the development I used [Protopie](https://www.protopie.io/) to prototype the game and the doctor app to a mid-fi level, making all the animations and connecting the data all together between the two apps. All the game and app UI and assets were made by me on Figma, I was inspired by the Monkey Island games for the looks.

The controller is a 3D printed vuvuzela with a micro-controller on the inside, that has an on-board microphone and accelerometer, and communicates with the apps via a local server. Using a microphone to measure the blow strength is a practice that [has been theorized](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/papers/SpiroSmart.CR.Final.pdf) in self-testing at home, but lacks medical precision. 
For my purpose was enough but in a future development of this game it could be interesting to remake it by hacking a spirometer gun.
