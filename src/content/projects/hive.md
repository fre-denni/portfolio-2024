### How can we represent the memory of a natural life? Hive is an attempt to fixate in time one millisecond of sound from a bee buzzing,  a sound that we could easily not find anymore in the future, mirroring how we still find vases from ancient ages, narrating cultures that are no longer presents. The vases were produced during the Milan Design Week 22, in a project in collaboration between Superforma and YOOX

#### THE DEVELOPMENT

From the soundtrack of a bee buzz, I extrapolated a sequence of it and then transformed a polar frequency of sound, resulting in round shapes that were transported into Fusion 360 to build the digital model of the vase. After adjusting it to meet the criteria of the production process, the vase was 3D printed during the week of the show, then dried in a process that lasted 2 days and baked for another 2.
