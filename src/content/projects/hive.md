### How can we represent the memory of a natural life? Hive is an attempt to fixate in time one millisecond of sound from a bee buzzing,  a sound that we could easily not find anymore in the future, mirroring how we still find vases from ancient ages, narrating of cultures that are no longer presents.
### The design and manufacturing were all made in occasion of an event during the Milan Design Week 2022, a collaboration between Superforma and YOOX, in which we produced together the vases in a live-event, and were then exposed in the space in Via Tortona.

#### THE DEVELOPMENT

From the sound track of a bee buzz, I extrapolated a sequence of it and then transformed a polar frequency of sound, resulting in round shapes that were transported into Fusion 360 to build the digital model of the vase. After adjusting it to meet the criteria of the production process, the vase was 3D printed during the week of the show, then dried in a process that lasted 2 days and baked for another 2.
