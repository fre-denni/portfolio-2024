## Scope of the project

HACKO is an open-source fermenter of bran developed for the Distributed Design Platform, with the scope of offering an alternative food source for restaurants and public canteens, designed to share teachings and DIY practices, promoting methods of production of food at home.

Our brief consisted in developing a toolkit to be produced 
in Fab Labs. We aimed to make the project accessible to people who do not have knowledge of fermentation, keeping it cheap and fun for our users.
We worked for 5 months in Polifactory, the Fab Lab of Politecnico, iterating with prototypes and our own production of bran. My role was to develop the interaction and the software architecture of the fermenter.

All project files are visible on the [Polifactory website](https://www.polifactory.polimi.it/en/portfolio/open-food-factory-ddp/).

### Interface Design

The design of the interface is based on interacting
with the Hackos, mascots that communicate with their colors the status of the fermented bran, that the user iterates with by touching the device.

To diminish energy waste an e-ink display is used.
