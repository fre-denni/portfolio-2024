### PIENE is a self-tracking device with the objective of lightening up and having fun of burnouts, in order to make people more aware of the effects of overwork on their lives.  Is inspired by the popular Italian saying of connecting how swollen are testicles to the burdens of work. Our prompt was to ask:  “But how much actually?”

#### PROJECT DEVELOPMENT

This project was the response to the one-week-long Qualitative Design Workshop led by [EPFL+ECAL lab](https://epfl-ecal-lab.ch/), with the aim to reflect on the importance of qualified and nuanced expressions of self-tracking data.

To do this we our data-collecting device is a soft fidget toy, usually used in stressful situations, shaped as a hearth/balls object, that simply collects the strength of the squeeze and compares it with the Google Calendar Activity.  The data is then shown as spheres that will steadily  cover your screen until it’s impossible to use.
