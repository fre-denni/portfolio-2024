### I'm always stoked at how some apps are simply there for being as useful as possibile without considering that sometimes they become excessively boring. I decided to find an interesting way of having a weather prediction that could engage me in fun ways using the power of Large Language Models

My process was really simple, I've used the open-source models paired with the [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) interface, and struct them together with API to have a simple app that could tell me the weather with a simple stanza or an haiku. The app interface and backed were all made with Python and the Flask development. Right now the app is still a W.I.P. but my hope it's to have it release in the public, so that other people can experiment a bit.
