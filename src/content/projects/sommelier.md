### the SOMMELIER experience aims to understand how much squeamishness will influence the variety of food that we will access in the future. By simulating the Italian Aperitivo experience, our user will be asked to substitute the food of today with alternatives of the future based on their taste and convictions.

We used a Critical Design approach, in the vision of the current political debate in Italy about the consumption of insect or lab meat, to make people surpass their own biases. 
The experience is designed to be made by two people, and they have to discuss how they will compose their future aperitivo tagliere, considering that with the increase of pollution and temperatures some of this food will simply disappear.

#### RESEARCH

We explored how quantifying taste in 5 basic values, impacted and pushed the narrative and their choices, making the discussion the main  drive of the interaction.  
  
In our process we iterated with our users, refining the language and the visual of the communication.  
  
By iterating with them we found that giving them rewards in the form of recipes and points helped in continuing the discussion.
