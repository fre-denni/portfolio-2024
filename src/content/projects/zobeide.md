### We were tasked to create a digital art experience inspired by the book ["Invisible Cities"](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_citt%C3%A0_invisibili) of Italo Calvino, in which we translated one of the cities presented in the book using the Stable Diffusion Generative AI model. Our choice was for the city of Zobeide, a city that people started building from their shared dreams, so we decided to make generative paintings starting from people's dreams.

The theme of creating from dreams is a recurrent one in the book of Calvino, which emphasizes the absurdity and sense of wonder in order to extrapolate interesting concepts.
For us the city of Zobeide is a perfect example of this: it’s a city that people built in a shared dream of a naked woman, that they were hunting in the woods. They decided then to go to the location of the hunting, and built a maze of traps with the sole scope of “capturing this dream”

So we decided to bring on this concept, making an online interactive art experience, which poses as objective to make people give form to their desire. We made an online form that categorized people based on their personality and then we asked them to narrate their city.

This was then built into a unifying prompt that was given to the model and generated the artwork. All artworks were then collected and put in an online art gallery, that you can find [here](https://visit.virtualartgallery.com/7324cdd7-d11f-4f63-aa67-c2f9b4571d30/).
