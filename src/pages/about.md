Ciao! I’m Federico, an Interaction Designer that likes to find opportunities in complex problems, break them down and squeeze out products and experiences.

Designer by day and Wannabe Developer by night,
I enjoy exploring new tech, and use coding to resolve problems.

I may have a obsession with microcontrollers.
