## About Me

Ciao! I’m Federico, an Interaction Designer that likes to find opportunities in complex problems, break them down and squeeze out products and experiences.
Designer by day and Wannabe Developer by night,
I enjoy exploring new tech, and use coding to resolve problems. <br/>
I may have a obsession with microcontrollers.
