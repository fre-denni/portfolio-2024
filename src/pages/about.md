## About Me

Ciao! I'm Federico Denni, pleased to meet you! <br/>
I'm an in-training interaction designer from Italy, working on products and interfaces trying to design meaningful moments for the present and the future,  in the least boring way.
<br/>

I believe in ideas over opinions, prototypes as the most valuable tool for collaboration, and exploring one hundred ideas to find the right one.
