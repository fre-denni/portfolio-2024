## About Me

Ciao! I'm Federico, pleased to meet you! <br/>
I'm an in-training interaction designer from Italy, working on products and interfaces trying to design meaningful moments for the present and the future,  in the least boring way.
<br/>

I like to explore new tools and technologies in my projects, learning from people so that I can narrate and develop my ideas better.
