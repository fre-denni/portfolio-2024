## About Me

Ciao! I'm Federico Denni, and I'm pleased to meet you! I'm an in-training interaction designer from Italy, working on products and interfaces trying to design for the present and the future. <br/>
My philosophy is that some playfulness is the key to making an interaction fun, transforming a problem into a meaningful experience, and making the world a little bit less boring.

I believe in ideas over opinions, prototypes as the most valuable tool for collaboration, and exploring one hundred ideas to find the right one.
